  CONTENT
  ATRR= NAME="VALUE" in openning tag
  WITHOUT ANY CONTENT= MUST USE INDIVIDUAL OPENNING and CLOSING TAG LIKE <p></p>
* bare minimum html file : [[file:doc-struct-before.html][example]]
* html rendered sequentially from top to bottom 
* html elements type
** BLOCK-LEVEL elements
   - Render to begin on a new line(by default can be changed by CSS)
   - May contain inline or other block-level elements
   - Roughly Flow Content in html5
** INLINE elements
   - Render on the same line (by default can be changed by CSS ?)
   - May only contain other inline elements
   - Roughly Prasing Content in html5
** USEFUL with existing CSS RULES
   - <div> basic block level elements
   - <span> super inline level elements
** [[file:div-and-span.html][example]]
* semantic html element
  element that implies some meaning to the content,help human or machine understand
  the meaning of the content by a semantic tags.
  - machine may use this to attach stylesheet
  - human understand the structrue better
  - BUT shoundn't use it for style but just structure
** TAGS
   - Heading elements [[file:semantic-headings.html][headings]]
   - More semantics elements [[file:more-semantics.html][more]]
     these html5 tags are just like =div=, just that they have implied meanings.
* lists for group structrue
** [[file:list-for-group-structure.html][example]]
   - ul : unordered list, only li for list item is allowed in there
   - ol : ul but ordered
* Character Entity Reference
  tell browser not to inteprete the symbol as html elements but just contents
  - =<= : =&lt=;
  - =>= : =&gt=;
  - =&= : =&amp=;
  - copyright symbol : =&copy=;
  - =&nbsp= : just for non-breakable, not for multiple spaces.
    multiple space should use a span with a left margin
  - =&quot= : for "" in multple encodings
** agendas [[file:character-entity-reference.html][example]]
*** avoid render issues such as =&lt;=
*** safeguard agaist more limited character encoding such as =&quot;=
*** provide characters not available on a keyboard such as =&copy;=
* Links between pages and pages content
  - =a= : archor
  - =href= : hyperlink refercen
  - =title= : for screen reading
  - =target= : for open a new window or a new tab for the link
** internal links
   use =#= before element id to construct a href
** external links
   use procotal scheme such as =http= to begin construct the href
** other files int the site
   the back link
** [[file:links.html][example]]
* Images
  use witdh and height whenever possible to safeguard layouts
** [[file:image.html][example]]
